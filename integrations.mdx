# What is an Integration

Integrations makes different computer programs talk to each other so they can share information and work together smoothly. Businesses today use tons of apps for their daily operations (we're trying to reduce that), so having connectivity between tools/software is crucial.

# How do I access the integrations?

**Requirement:** Team Package, Business Package, Enterprise

* Go to **Dashboard:**

* Click your **company:** from the list

* Then click the **"Integrations":** from the menu bar.

* From there, you see all the available apps that you can connect to.
