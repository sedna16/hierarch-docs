# What is an Integration

Integrations makes different computer programs talk to each other so they can share information and work together smoothly. Businesses today use tons of apps for their daily operations (we're trying to reduce that), so having connectivity between tools/software is crucial.

**Requirement:** Team Package, Business Package, Enterprise

* Go to **Dashboard:**
