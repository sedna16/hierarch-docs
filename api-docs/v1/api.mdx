# What is an API?

API stands for Application Programming Interface. It is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate with each other. APIs define the methods and data formats that applications can use to request and exchange information. They serve as an interface between different software systems, enabling them to work together seamlessly.

# What is a REST API?
