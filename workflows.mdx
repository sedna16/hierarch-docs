## What is a Workflow?

A workflow is a sequence of tasks or processes that are automated to achieve a specific outcome. It connects various actions, decisions, and triggers, allowing for efficient, streamlined operations by reducing manual work. It can range from simple to complex, enabling businesses to automate repetitive tasks and improve productivity across different systems and departments.
