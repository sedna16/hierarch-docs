A Form Builder is a game-changer for your agency, simplifying how you collect and manage client information, project requests, feedback, and approvals. Instead of relying on back-and-forth emails or manual data entry, you can create custom forms that streamline client onboarding, automate lead capture, and keep everything organized in one place. With features like conditional logic, file uploads, and integrations with your favorite tools, forms adapt to your workflow, ensuring efficiency and accuracy.
