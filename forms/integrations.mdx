Forms can be seamlessly integrated into your processes in multiple ways, giving you flexibility in how you collect and manage data. You can connect forms directly to Workflows, automating tasks such as assigning leads, triggering email notifications, or updating records based on form submissions. For more advanced integrations, Webhooks allow you to send data in real-time to external systems, ensuring smooth communication between platforms. If you want to embed a form on your website, you can do so effortlessly, providing a seamless experience for users without redirecting them elsewhere. And for a quick and simple approach, you can share the form link directly, making it easy for clients, team members, or prospects to fill it out anytime, from anywhere.
