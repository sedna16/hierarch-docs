The Form Builder makes it easy to create custom forms for data collection, customer onboarding, feedback, and internal processes. With a simple drag-and-drop interface, you can design forms that fit your needs—whether it’s capturing leads, handling support requests, or automating approvals. Advanced customization, conditional logic, and seamless integrations allow you to connect forms with your existing tools. Responses are automatically organized, eliminating manual data entry and ensuring smooth workflows. Plus, you can implement the Form Builder with your existing automations, streamlining processes and enhancing efficiency across your business.
