Form fields give your agency the flexibility to collect exactly the information you need, ensuring every form is tailored to your workflow. With a variety of field types—such as text inputs, dropdowns, file uploads, and checkboxes—you can capture client details, project requirements, feedback, and approvals in a structured and organized way. Customizable fields help standardize data collection while allowing for dynamic adjustments using conditional logic, so clients and team members only see relevant fields based on their responses.
