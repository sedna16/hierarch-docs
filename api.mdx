# What is an API?

API stands for Application Programming Interface. It is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate with each other. APIs define the methods and data formats that applications can use to request and exchange information. They serve as an interface between different software systems, enabling them to work together seamlessly.

# What is a REST API?

A RESTful API (Representational State Transfer) is a type of web API that adheres to the principles of REST, which is an architectural style for designing networked applications. RESTful APIs are widely used in web development due to their simplicity, scalability, and stateless nature.

# How to authenticate?

To connect to the API framework, you will need to authenticate your requests via an API key. How to authenticate, just add your api key like so:

# Input

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash javascript
  var url = 'https://api.hierarch.io/v1/endpoint/action/<company_slug>/?token=<YOUR_API_KEY>'
  ```

  ```
  $url = 'https://api.hierarch.io/v1/endpoint/action/<company_slug>/?token=<YOUR_API_KEY>
  ```

  ```
  url = 'https://api.hierarch.io/v1/endpoint/action/<company_slug>/?token=<YOUR_API_KEY>'
  ```
</CodeGroup>
