## Overview

The "Client Edited" trigger is a powerful workflow initiator that activates automatically when a client's information is updated or modified in the pipeline. This trigger serves as the starting point for your workflow, allowing you to create responsive processes that react to changes in client data. By leveraging this trigger, you can ensure that your team stays informed and takes appropriate actions whenever client details are edited, helping to maintain up-to-date records and streamline client management tasks.
