## Overview

The "Ticket Edited" trigger is a powerful workflow initiator that activates when an employee or personnel modifies a client's ticket or complaint. This trigger serves as the starting point for your workflow, allowing you to automate actions or processes based on updates made to existing tickets. By leveraging this trigger, you can ensure timely responses and maintain efficient ticket management as your team addresses and refines client issues.
