## Overview

The "Pipeline Changed" trigger is a powerful workflow initiator that activates when an item's pipeline stage is modified or moved. This trigger serves as the starting point for your workflow, automatically detecting changes in an item's status within your pipeline and enabling you to set up responsive actions based on these transitions.
