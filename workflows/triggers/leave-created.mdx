## Overview

The "Leave Created" trigger is a workflow initiator that activates when an employee or personnel submits a request for leave of absence. This trigger serves as the starting point for the workflow, automatically initiating the process once a leave request is made. It enables a streamlined and efficient handling of leave applications within the organization.
