The "Personnel Created" trigger is an automated workflow initiator that activates when a new employee or personnel record is added to the system. This trigger serves as the starting point for workflows designed to streamline onboarding processes, initiate necessary administrative tasks, or trigger other relevant actions within the organization. By leveraging this trigger, companies can ensure a consistent and efficient response to new personnel additions, enhancing overall operational effectiveness.
