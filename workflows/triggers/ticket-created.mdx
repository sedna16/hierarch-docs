## Overview

The "Ticket Created" trigger is a workflow initiator that activates when a client submits a new ticket or complaint with an attached assignment. This trigger serves as the starting point for your workflow, automatically detecting the creation of a new ticket and setting subsequent actions in motion. By utilizing this trigger, you can ensure prompt and efficient handling of client issues from the moment they are reported.
