## Overview

The "Client Created" trigger is a workflow initiator that activates automatically when a new client is added to the pipeline. This trigger serves as the starting point for your workflow, allowing you to set up automated processes or actions that should occur immediately after a client is created. By utilizing this trigger, you can streamline your client onboarding process and ensure consistent follow-up procedures for every new client in your system.
