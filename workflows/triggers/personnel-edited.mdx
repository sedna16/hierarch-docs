## Overview

The "Personnel Edited" trigger initiates a workflow when a personnel or employee record is updated or modified in the pipeline. This trigger activates at the start of the workflow, allowing you to automate processes or actions based on changes made to employee information. It's a useful tool for keeping your HR processes up-to-date and responsive to personnel data modifications.
