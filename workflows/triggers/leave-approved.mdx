## Overview

The "Leave Approved" trigger is a workflow initiator that activates when an employee's leave request has been officially approved. This trigger serves as the starting point for subsequent automated actions or notifications within the leave management process. It ensures that relevant parties are informed and necessary steps are taken once a leave of absence is granted.
