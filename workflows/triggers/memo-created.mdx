## Overview

The "Memo Created" trigger initiates a workflow when a new memo is generated for a specific employee or personnel. This trigger activates at the beginning of the workflow process, serving as the starting point for subsequent actions or tasks. It's designed to streamline memo-related procedures, ensuring that relevant processes are set in motion as soon as a memo is created.
