## Overview

The "Announcement Created" trigger is a workflow initiator that activates when a company-wide announcement is made. This trigger serves as the starting point for automated processes, allowing you to streamline actions or notifications that should occur immediately after an announcement is published. By utilizing this trigger, you can ensure timely and consistent follow-up activities across your organization whenever important company news is shared.
