## Overview

The "Review Created" trigger is a workflow initiator that activates when a client posts a new review about your company's products or services. This trigger serves as the starting point for automated processes, allowing you to promptly respond to and manage customer feedback. By leveraging this trigger, you can ensure timely engagement with client reviews and maintain a proactive approach to customer satisfaction.
