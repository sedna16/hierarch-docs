## Overview

The "Leave Denied" trigger is a workflow initiator that activates when an employee's request for leave of absence is not approved. This trigger serves as the starting point for subsequent actions or processes within the workflow, allowing for automated responses or notifications following a leave denial. It helps streamline the leave management process by ensuring prompt and consistent handling of denied leave requests.
