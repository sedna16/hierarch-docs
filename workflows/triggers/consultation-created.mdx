## Overview

The "Consultation Created" trigger is an automated workflow initiator that activates when a client submits a request for consultation. This trigger serves as the starting point for your workflow, allowing you to promptly respond to and manage incoming consultation requests. By leveraging this trigger, you can ensure that each new consultation inquiry is efficiently processed and handled according to your established procedures.
