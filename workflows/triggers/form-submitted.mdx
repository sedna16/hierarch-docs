## Overview

The "Announcement Created" trigger initiates a workflow when a new entry is submitted through a form created with the form builder feature. This trigger activates at the start of the workflow, allowing you to automate actions based on the newly submitted form data. It provides a seamless way to respond to and process information as soon as it's received, enhancing your workflow efficiency.
