## Overview

A webhook trigger is an automated mechanism that allows applications to receive real-time notifications about specific events or data changes. It enables seamless communication between different systems by sending HTTP POST requests to a predefined URL whenever a specified event occurs. Webhook triggers are essential for building responsive and interconnected applications, allowing developers to create efficient workflows and automate processes based on external events.
