## Overview

The "Create Assignment" module allows you to easily set up a new assignment in the pipeline. Here, you can assign the client, designate the responsible personnel, and provide them with the necessary handbook or SOP. This feature helps ensure that each assignment is properly structured and all relevant information is shared.
